## The Walk-Through

The walkthrough file contains all the current levels of Bandit with small descriptions of each level. Additionally, each level is done slightly differently to introduce new ideas or commands that can be very useful when navigating the system via the command line.

## The Levels

Within the levels folder is a series of scripts to solve each level automatically. These were done to show how automation could be used to solve problems or automate tasks. This is a work in progress and gives me the ability to solve multiple levels without interactions or manually running commands. As the scripts could be chained together, the challenge is to solve as many as possible in one command.
